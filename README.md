# MyHealthCareApp
Introduction

The use of mobile applications for healthcare is a young and dynamic field that could improve the well-being of people around the world.
Mobile applications can lower costs and improve the quality of healthcare as well as shift behavior to strengthen prevention, all of which 
can improve health outcomes over the long term (World Bank, 2011). 

Problem Statement 
Most countries in developed countries are increasingly using an electronic medical record (EMR) to improve work process,
patient safety and quality of healthcare. Unfortunately, most developing countries address many drawbacks and barriers in implementing EMR,
in providing a real time help for physician and in providing just in time learning.

Proposed Solution 
In this project we are implementing a mobile application that can be used for multipurpose. That decrease the problem of inappropriate
handling of medical health record by using database that save the patient information. 
That allow physician to refer either an online help or reference from document in case if there is no internet connection and that help 
the healthcare practitioners to take note when they are getting help from both document and internet.


Android features used in this project
	Data Persistence: Firebase, SQLite, Room Persistence Library 
	Files and Permissions: Files from asset folder, permission for WIFI, Contacts…etc.
	Service: Checking a ringtone for the alarm
	Broadcast: We have implemented two different broadcast activity. One for opening either wifi is on or off incase if the healthcare 
            practitioners seek an internet help, the other is for an alarm.
